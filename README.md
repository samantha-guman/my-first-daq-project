## 🧼 Data Cleaning Process  

Data cleaning was performed first in **Python** (for speed and precision) and later refined in **Excel** for Power BI compatibility.

### Steps Taken:
1. Removed unnamed and blank columns (`Unnamed: 9–25`).
2. Deleted empty rows and corrected missing dates.  
3. Trimmed and standardized all text fields (e.g., “ yes ” → “Yes”).  
4. Converted all numeric columns to proper number formats.  
5. Standardized “Promotion Active” entries to only **Yes/No**.  
6. Verified data types for consistency and saved as `TastyBites_Cleaned.xlsx`.
